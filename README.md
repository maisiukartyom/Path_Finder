# Path finding visualization using A* algorithm

## How to test?
1. You can move S (start) and E (end) positions on the grid by switching checkboxes.
2. If you haven't checked any checkbox you can place an obstacle by simply clicking on the desired cell.
3. Once you've initialized the desired grid click "Visualize path" to see the path and execution time.
4. You can also change grid size using drop-down menu.
5. Click "Reset field" to reset all the changes and found paths.

**HAPPY TESTING!** üòÅ
